    "In the shared drive ```cds-vis-data```, you'll find a directory comprising 1360 different images of flowers. Many of these are different images of the same flower.\n",

    "\n",
    "- Pick a random flower from the dataset, load it, and normalize it\n",
    "- Compare that image's colour histogram to every *other* flower in the dataset\n",
    "- Print save the filename of the 5 closest images, along with the distance score you calculated\n",
    "  - **Hint:** use ```pandas```\n",
    "- Qualitatively inspect the images - how does your algorithm perform?\n",
